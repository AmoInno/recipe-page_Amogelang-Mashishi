## My process

I mapped out the html structure first and then added it before styling. This was easier for me before styling as it gave me the backbone of the project. I did default styling on the largest screen first then when everything was properly styled and placed in the larger screens, I made alterations to the CSS properties so that it shows properly when the screen sizes decrease.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media properties

### What I learned

- This project helped me alot with responsive design. The method that I used proved to be very efficient in terms of responsive design.
- I split the project in smaller sections and that helped me to work efficiently and was not overwhelming.
This project taught me to breakdown my projects into smaller parts.
- It deepened my understanding of CSS properties and HTML structure, providing me an opportunity to apply and practice the knowledge that I have accquired in a more practical setting.

### Continued development

- Responsive design: I would like to continue to get better in responsive design. Ensuring that the websites that I make is able to work on all screen sizes can be very tricky. Knowing which properties to alter and when is a skill that I would like to continue to master. 

- Time-management: I would like to continue to improve the time that I take to work on projects.That is something that will come with time but definately something that I would like to improve.

- Debugging: Improve my debugging process. I tend to spend a long time debugging and would like to improve that.
